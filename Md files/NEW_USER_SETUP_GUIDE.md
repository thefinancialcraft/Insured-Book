# New User Setup Modal - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation adds a modal that automatically appears for newly approved users to complete their account setup by updating their phone number and password.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Detection
- Detects when a user gets approved status
- Shows modal only for users who haven't completed initial setup
- Uses database functions for efficient checking

### 2. Modal Functionality
- **Phone Number Update**: Validates and updates user's contact number
- **Password Update**: Allows users to set their password for manual login
- **Skip Option**: Users can skip setup and complete it later
- **Form Validation**: Comprehensive validation for both fields

### 3. Database Integration
- Tracks setup completion status
- Logs all setup activities
- Prevents modal from showing multiple times

## Components

### NewUserSetupModal.tsx
- Main modal component
- Handles form validation and submission
- Integrates with Supabase for updates
- Provides skip functionality

### useNewUserSetup.ts
- Custom hook for managing setup state
- Detects when modal should be shown
- Handles setup completion tracking

## Database Functions

### needs_initial_setup(user_id)
- Checks if user needs to complete initial setup
- Returns true if user is approved but missing phone/password

### mark_initial_setup_completed(user_id)
- Marks user as having completed setup
- Prevents modal from showing again

### mark_setup_modal_shown(user_id)

- Used when user skips setup

## Integration Points

### AuthGuard Component
- Shows modal globally when needed
- Ensures modal appears on any page for new users

### ApprovalPending Component
- Shows modal specifically on approval pending page
- Provides immediate setup opportunity after approval

## User Flow

1. **User gets approved** → Status changes to 'approved'
2. **Modal appears** → User sees setup modal automatically
3. **User completes setup** → Phone and password are updated
4. **Modal disappears** → User can access full application

## Security Features

- RLS policies ensure users can only update their own profiles
- Password updates go through Supabase Auth (secure)
- All activities are logged for audit purposes
- Modal cannot be dismissed without action (skip or complete)

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Database function testing
- Form validation testing
- Integration with existing auth flow
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed. The system automatically:
